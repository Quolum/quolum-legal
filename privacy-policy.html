          evidence in litigation in which we are involved.

      <h3 id="cookies">3. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>In Short:</strong> <i> We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your
          information.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store
        information. Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies
        is set out in our Cookie Notice.
      </p>

      <h3 id="inforetain">4. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>In Short:</strong> <i> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes
          outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this

        longer than 180 days.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete
        or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information
        has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it
        from any further processing until deletion is possible.
      </p>

      <h3 id="infosafe">5. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>In Short:</strong> <i> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of
          organizational and technical security measures.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the
        security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your
        information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be
        guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other
        unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal,
        or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission
        of personal information to and from our Website is at your own risk. You should only access the Website
        within a secure environment.
      </p>

        <strong>In Short:</strong> <i> We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of
          age.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Website, you
        represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to
        such minor dependent’s use of the Website. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18
        years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly
        delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under
        age 18, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@quolum.com">privacy@quolum.com.</a>
      </p>

      <h3 id="privacyrights">7. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>In Short:</strong> <i> You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.</i>

        authority. You can find their contact details here: <a

      <h3 id="DNT">8. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h3>
      <p>
        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT")
        feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online
        browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing
        and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals
        or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard
        for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in
        a revised version of this privacy notice.
